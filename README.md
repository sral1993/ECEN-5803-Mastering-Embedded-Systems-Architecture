# Embedded System Design Evaluations
In this project, I have evaluated various MCU's and MPU's for suitability of three applications.
<br>
1. Flow meter <br>
2. Signal Analyzer <br>
3. VOIP Gateway <br>

<b> Flow meter </b> <br>
The main emphasis is to determine whether the Freescale KL25Z MCU is a right choice for the Sierra’s Model 240V In-line Volumetric Vortex Meter. A collective decision has to be made considering all of their technical specifications and requirements:
1. Design a novel Assembly Arithmetic algorithm as an alternative to the FPU.
2. Perform an analysis to integrate the hardware components along with KL25Z
3. Evaluate the Mbed® SDK and Keil® uVision in terms of adaptability
4. Understand the limitations in Hardware/Software integration
5. Provide with realistic estimation of system performance and cost analysis
6. Come up with the final recommendation on KL25Z for the functional Flowmeter under desired specifications
